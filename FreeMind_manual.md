## Adding Icons

* A node can have several icons.
  * It can have the same icon more than once
* To add icons to a node, select a node and click one of the icons displayed in the left toolbar.
* To remove one icon, press red cross at the top of the icon toolbar.
* To remove all icons, press trash can icon at the top of the icon toolbar.
* To add a new icon to a node without using the left toolbar, press Alt + I
* Currently, it is not easy to extend the icons present in FreeMind(See FreeMind's wiki for an explanation). This will probably change in the next release.
* To hide or show the icon toolbar, in the context menu at the background use Toggle Left Toolbar. The icon toolbar is called left toolbar there.
* The icons as attached to this node are included, and more.
* Icon tweaks
  * If you press SHIFT while adding an icon from the icon toolbar, all other icons are removed from this node before adding the new one
  * If you press CONTROL while clicking on an icon, the first occurrence of this icon will be removed.

## Adding graphical links

* To create a graphical link between two nodes, drag a node and drop it to another node holding both shift and control keys; release the mouse button before releasing shift and control keys.
* Alternatively, you can select two nodes using Ctrl and to choose "Add graphical link" from the "Insert" menu or its shortcut Ctrl+L
* Context Menu
  * To change the color of the link, use link context menu, by right-clicking the graphical link.
  * To change the arrows of the link, use link context menu.
  * To delete a link, use link context menu.
  * To navigate to one of the end nodes of the link, use link context menu.
* To change the routing of an arrow link, drag it and move it
* An example of graphical link follows
* Example
  * Link to another part
  * Node with folded subnode
    * subnode
  * Another link

## Searching

* To find text in a node and all its descendant nodes, press Ctrl + F or in the "edit" menu use Find.
* To find the next match of your search, press Ctrl +ï¼§ or in the "edit" menu Find Next.
* To search the whole map, select the central node by pressing Escape before searching.
* The search is a breadth-first search. This is because the deeper a node, the greater the detail described in the node.
* Search will only search the selected node and its descendants. To search the entire mind map, either select the central node directly, or press \<ESC> before searching to automatically search from the central node.
* If you enter multiple words into the find dialog, then each word must occur (but not necessarily in that order)
* If you want to search for a given sentence then put it into quotation marks.
  * Example
    * one
      * one one
      * one two
    * two
      * two one
      * two two
  * Searching for ...
    * one one (without quotations), you'll get four hits.
    * one two (without quotations), you'll get two hits.
    * "one one", you'll get only one hit.
* New interactive search
  * Using CONTROL+SHIFT+F you'll see the new search and replace dialog
  * It searches the whole mindmap
  * It supports regular expressions
  * It finds when you type.


## Selecting multiple nodes

* To select multiple nodes, hold control or shift while clicking.
* To add single nodes to already selected nodes, hold control when clicking.
* To select a continuous range of nodes, hold shift when clicking, or hold shift while moving around with arrow keys.
* To select a complete subtree, hold AltGr while clicking, or hold shift while moving with arrow keys from a node to its parent. Finally Ctrl+Shift+A does the same via the keyboard.
* To cancel the selection of multiple nodes, click on the map background or onto an unselected node.

## Dragging and dropping

* You can move nodes around using drag and drop.
* To drop a node as a child, position the cursor at the outer part of the node while dropping.
* To copy nodes rather than move, hold control while dragging, or drag with middle mouse button.
* To edit an existing map, drag its file and drop it on the background of FreeMind; this works at least in Microsoft Windows operating system.
* If you have selected multiple nodes, all are being moved or copied.
* You can drop data from external applications, like files on Microsoft Windows operating system, or pieces of text selected in a browser.
